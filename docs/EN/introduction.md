## What is an “Artificial Pancreas System”?

A human pancreas does a lot of things besides regulating blood sugar. However, the term **“Artificial Pancreas System” (APS)** usually refers to a system which works to automatically keep blood sugar levels within healthy limits.

The most basic way to do this is by detecting **glucose levels**, using these values to do **calculations**, and then delivering the (predicted) right amount of **insulin** to the body. It repeats the calculation, every few minutes, 24/7. It uses **alarms** and **alerts** to inform the user if intervention or attention is needed. This system is typically made up of a **glucose sensor**, an **insulin pump** and an **app** on a phone.

You can read more about the different artificial pancreas systems currently in use and in development in this 2022 review article:

In the near future, some so-called "dual-hormone" systems will also have the ability to infuse glucagon alongside insulin, with the aim of preventing severe hypos and allowing even tighter blood glucose control.

An artificial pancreas can be thought of as an [“autopilot for your diabetes”](https://www.artificialpancreasbook.com/)

What does that mean?
In an aircraft, an autopilot does not do the complete job of the human pilot, the pilot cannot sleep through the entire flight. The autopilot aids the work of the pilot. It relieves them of the burden of permanently monitoring the aircraft, allowing the pilot to concentrate on wider monitoring from time to time. The autopilot receives signals from various sensors, a computer evaluates them together with the pilot’s specifications and then makes the necessary adjustments, alerting the pilot to any concerns. The pilot no longer has to worry about constantly making decisions.

## What does hybrid closed loop mean? 

The best solution for type 1 diabetes would be a “functional cure” (probably an implant of pancreatic cells which are protected from the immune system). While we are waiting for that, a “full closed loop” artificial pancreas is probably the next best thing. This is a tech system that doesn’t need any user input (like bolusing insulin for meals, or announcing exercise), with good regulation of blood glucose levels. At the moment, there are no widely available systems which are “full” closed loop, they all need some user input. The currently available systems are called “hybrid” closed loop, because they use a combination of automated technology and user input. 

## How and why did looping start?
 
The development of commercial technology for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is very slow. In 2013 the T1D community founded the #WeAreNotWaiting movement. They developed systems themselves using existing approved technology (insulin pumps and sensors) to improve blood glucose control, safety, and quality of life. These are known as DIY (do-it-yourself) systems, because they are not formally approved by health bodies (FDA, NHS etc). There are four main DIY systems available: [OpenAPS](https://openaps.org/what-is-openaps/), **AAPS**, [Loop](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/#what-is-loop) and [iAPS]( https://github.com/Artificial-Pancreas/iAPS?fbclid=IwAR2fA9Y9YqYzpKSrtEsotfXl5b67UclDkKgyrv52tQLzYbOoBeNGRmjlJJI). 

A great way to understand the fundamentals of DIY looping is to read Dana Lewis’s book “Automated Insulin Delivery”. You can access it [here](https://www.artificialpancreasbook.com/) for free (or buy a hardcopy of the book). If you want to understand more about [OpenAPS](https://openaps.org/what-is-openaps/), which **AAPS** has developed from, the [OpenAPS website](https://openaps.org/what-is-openaps/) is a great resource. 

Several commercial hybrid closed loop systems have been launched, the most recent of which are [CamAPS FX](https://camdiab.com/) (UK and EU) and [Omnipod 5](https://www.omnipod.com/en-gb/what-is-omnipod/omnipod-5) (USA and EU). These are very different to DIY systems, mainly because they both include a “learning algorithm” which adjusts how much insulin is delivered according to your insulin needs from previous days. Many people in the DIY community have already tried out these commercial systems and compared them with their DIY system. You can find out more about how the different systems compare by asking on the dedicated Facebook groups for these systems, on the [AAPS Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AndroidAPSUsers/) or on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4fQUWHZ4Mw).

## What is Android APS (AAPS)?

**Figure 1**. Basic outline of the Android APS (Artificial Pancreas System), AAPS.

Android APS (**AAPS**) is a hybrid closed loop system, or Artificial Pancreas System  (APS). It makes its insulin dosing calculations using established [OpenAPS](https://openaps.org/) algorithms (a set of rules) developed by the #WeAreNotWaiting type 1 diabetes community. 

Since OpenAPS is only compatible with certain older insulin pumps, **AAPS** (which can be used with a wider range of insulin pumps) was developed in 2016 by Milos Kozak, for a family member with type 1 diabetes. Since those early days, **AAPS** has been continually developed and refined by a team of volunteer computer developers and other enthusiasts who have a connection to the type 1 diabetes world. Today, **AAPS** is used by approximately 10,000 people. It is a highly customisable and versatile system, and because it is open-source, it is also readily compatible with many other open-source diabetes softwares and platforms. The fundamental components of the current **AAPS** system are outlined in **Figure 1** above. 

## What are the basic components of AAPS?

The “brain” of AAPS is an **app** which you build yourself. There are detailed step-by-step instructions for this. You then install the **AAPS  app** on a [compatible](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zO-Vf3wv0jji5Gflk6pe48oi348ApF5RvMcI6NG5TnY/edit?pli=1#gid=2097219952) **Android smartphone** (**1**). A number of users prefer their loop on a separate phone to their main phone. So, you don’t necessarily have to be using an Android phone for everything else in your life, just for running your AAPS loop.  

The **Android smartphone** will also need to have another app installed on it as well as **AAPS**. This is either a modified Dexcom app called build-your-own dexcom app [**BYODA**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScD76G0Y-BlL4tZljaFkjlwuqhT83QlFM5v6ZEfO7gCU98iJQ/viewform?fbzx=2196386787609383750&fbclid=IwAR2aL8Cps1s6W8apUVK-gOqgGpA-McMPJj9Y8emf_P0-_gAsmJs6QwAY-o0) or [**Xdrip+**](https://xdrip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/usethedoc/). This additional app receives glucose data from a sensor (**2**) by bluetooth, and then sends the data internally on the phone to the **AAPS app**. 

The **AAPS app** uses a decision making process (**algorithm**) from OpenAPS. Beginners  start out using the basic **oref0** algorithm, but it is possible to switch to using the newer **oref1** algorithm as you progress with AAPS. Which algorithm you use (oref0 or oref1), depends on which suits your specific situation best.  In both cases, the algorithm takes into account multiple factors, and performs rapid calculations every time a new reading comes in from the sensor. The algorithm then sends instructions to the insulin pump (**3**) on how much insulin to deliver by bluetooth. All the information can be sent by mobile data or wifi to the internet (**4**). This data can also be shared with followers if desired, and/or collected for analysis.

## What are the advantages of the AAPS system? 

The OpenAPS algorithm used by **AAPS** controls blood sugar levels in the absence of user input, according to the users’ defined parameters (important ones being basal rates, insulin sensitivity factors, insulin-to-carb ratios, duration of insulin activity etc.), reacting every 5 minutes to the new sensor data. Some of the reported advantages of using AAPS are extensive fine-tunable options, automations and increased transparency of the system for the patient/caregiver. This can result in better control over your (or your dependent’s) diabetes, which in turn may give improved quality of life and increased peace of mind.  

**Practical advantages include:** 

- **Hardware flexibility**: **AAPS** works with a wide range of insulin pumps and sensors. So for example, if you develop an allergy to Dexcom sensor patch glue, you could switch to using a Libre sensor instead. That offers flexibility as life changes. You don't have to rebuild or reinstall the ***AAPS** app, just tick a different box in the app to change your hardware.
    
- **Highly customisable, with wide parameters**: here are some examples of the possibilities with AAPS:
    a) The ability to set a lower glucose target 30 min before eating; you can set the target as low as 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L).
    b) If you are insulin-resistant resulting in high blood sugars, **AAPS** allows you to set an **automation** rule  to activate when BG rises above 8 mmol/L (144 mg/dL), switching to (for example) a 120% profile (resulting in an 20% increase in basal and strengthening of other factors too, compared to your normal **profile** setting). The automation will last according to the scheduled time you set. Such an automation could be set to only be active on certain days of the week, at certain times of day, and even at certain locations.
    c) If your child is on a trampoline with no advance notice, **AAPS** allows insulin  suspension for a set time period, directly via the phone.
    d) After reconnecting a tubed pump which has been disconnected for  swimming, **AAPS** will calculate the basal insulin you have missed while disconnected and deliver it carefully, according to your current BG. Any insulin not required can be overridden by just “cancelling” the missed basal.
    f) **AAPS** has the facility for you to set different profiles for different situations and easily switch between them. For example, features which make the algorithm quicker to bring down elevated BG (like supermicro boluses (“**SMB**”), unannounced meals, (“**UAM**”) can be set to only work during the daytime, if you are worried about night-time hypos. 
    
These are all examples, the full range of features gives huge flexibility for daily life including sport, illness, hormone cycles _etc_. Ultimately, it is for the user to decide how to use this flexibility, and there is no one-size-fits-all automation for this.

- **Remote monitoring**: there are multiple possible monitoring channels (Sugarmate, Dexcom Follow, Xdrip+, Android Auto _etc._) which are useful for parents/carers and adults in certain scenarios (sleeping/driving) who need customisable alerts. In some apps (Xdrip+) you can also turn alarms off totally, which is great if you have a new sensor “soaking” or settling down that you don’t want to loop with yet. 
    
- **Remote control**: a significant advantage of **AAPS** over commercial systems is that it is possible for followers, using authenticated text (SMS) commands or via an app ([Nightscout](https://nightscout.github.io/) or NSClient) to send a wide range of commands back to the **AAPS** system. This is used extensively by parents of kids with type 1 diabetes who use AAPS. It is very useful: for example, in the playground, if you want to pre-bolus for a snack from your own phone, and your child is busy playing. It is possible to monitor the system (_e.g._ Fitbit), send basic commands (_e.g._ Samsung Galaxy watch 4), or even run the entire AAPS system from a high-spec smartwatch (**5**) (_e.g._ LEMFO LEM14). In this last scenario, you don’t need to use a phone to run AAPS. As battery life on watches improves and technology becomes more stable, this last option is likely to become increasingly attractive.
    
- **No commercial constraints, due to open application interfaces**: beyond the use of an open-source approach, which allows the source code of **AAPS** to be viewed at any time, the general principle of providing open programming interfaces gives other developers the opportunity to contribute new ideas too. This accelerates development and allows users to add on features to make life with diabetes even more convenient. Good examples for such integrations are [NightScout](https://nightscout.github.io/), [Nightscout Reporter](https://nightscout-reporter.zreptil.de/), [Xdrip+](https://xdrip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/usethedoc/), [M5 stack](https://github.com/mlukasek/M5_NightscoutMon/wiki?fbclid=IwAR1pupoCy-2GuXLS7tIO8HRkOC_536YqSxTK7eF0UrKkM1PuucFYRyPFvd0) etc. There is ongoing dialogue between open-source developers and those developing commercial systems. Many of the DIY innovations are gradually adopted by commercial systems, where developments are understandably slower, partly because interfaces between systems from different companies (pumps, apps, sensors _etc_) need to be carefully negotiated and licenced. This can also slow innovations which are convenient for the patient (or a small sub-population of patients, who have a very specific requirement) but do not generate any sizable profit. 
    
- **Detailed app interface**: with **AAPS** it is easy to keep track of things like: pump insulin levels, cannula age, sensor age, pump battery age, insulin-on-board _etc_. Many actions can be done through the **AAPS** app (priming the pump, disconnecting the pump _etc_.), instead of on the pump itself, which means the pump can stay in your (or your dependent's) pocket or belt. 
    
- **Accessibility and affordability**: **AAPS** gives people who currently can’t afford to self-fund, or don’t have funding/insurance, access to a world-class hybrid closed looping system which is conceptually years ahead, in terms of development, of the commercial systems. You currently need to have a Nightscout account to set up **AAPS**, although the Nightscout account is not required for day-to-day running of the **AAPS** loop. Many people continue to use Nightscout for collecting their data, and for remote control. Although **AAPS** itself is free, setting up Nightscout through one of the various platforms may incur a fee (€0 - €12), depending on what level of support you want (see comparison table). **AAPS** works with a wide range of affordable (starting from approx €150) Android phones. In comparison, Loop currently costs around €80 a year for the Apple development licence, and CamAPS FX costs around €80/month (prices last checked in June 2023).
    
- ****Support**: No automated insulin delivery system is perfect. Commercial and open-source systems share many common glitches in both communications and temporary hardware failure. There is support available from community of AAPS users on Facebook, Discord and Github who designed, developed and are currently using **AAPS**, all over the world. There are also Facebook support groups and help from clinic/commercial companies for the commercial APS systems -  it is worth speaking to the users, or former users of these systems to get feedback on the common glitches, the quality of the education programme and the level of ongoing support provided.
    
- **Predictability, transparency and safety**: with no learning algorithm, **AAPS** is logical and in some respects, more predictable, which may make it easier to know when a setting is wrong, and to adjust it accordingly. You can see exactly what the system is doing, why it is doing it, and set its operational limits, which puts the control (and responsibility) in your hands. This can provide the user with confidence, and a sounder sleep. 
    
- **Access to advanced features through dev modes including full closed loop**: this **AAPS** documentation focuses on the mainstream **“master”** branch of **AAPS**. However, research and development is going on all the time. More experienced users may wish to explore the experimental features in the **development** branch. This includes integration of Dexcom G7, and automatically adjusting insulin delivery according to short-term sensitivity changes (DYNISF). The development innovations focus on strategies for full closed looping (not having to bolus for meals _etc._), and generally trying to make life with type 1 diabetes as convenient as possible.
    
- **Ability to contribute yourself to further improvements**: type 1 diabetes can be highly frustrating and isolating. Having control over your own diabetes tech, with the possibility to “pay it forward” as soon as you are making progress by helping others on their journey can be really rewarding. You can educate yourself, discover the roadblocks and look for, and even contribute, to new developments and the documentation. There will be others in the community with the same quest that you can bounce ideas off and work with. This is the essence of #WeAreNotWaiting.
    
## How does AAPS compare to MDI and open looping? 

Multiple daily injections (MDI, (a) in **Figure 2** below) usually involve giving an injection of a long-lasting insulin (_e.g._ Tresiba) once a day, with injections of faster-acting insulin (_e.g._ Novorapid, Fiasp) at mealtimes, or for corrections. Open pumping (b) involves using a pump to deliver basal at pre-programmed rates of rapid-acting insulin, and then boluses through the pump at mealtimes or for corrections. The basics of a looping system are that the looping app uses the sensor glucose data to instruct the pump to stop insulin delivery when it predicts you are heading for a low, and to give you extra insulin if your glucose levels are rising and predicted to go too high (c). Although this figure is oversimplified, it shows the potential of closed looping.

**Figure 2**. Basic overview of (a) MDI, (b) open-loop pumping and (c) hybrid closed loop pumping. Real-life scenarios are more complex, this aims to demonstrate the key differences of the approaches. It is possible to achieve exceptionally good glucose control with any of these three approaches. 

## How does AAPS compare to other looping systems?

At present there are four major open source closed loop systems available: [OpenAPS](https://openaps.readthedocs.io/), **AAPS**, [Loop](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/#what-is-loop) and [iAPS](https://github.com/Artificial-Pancreas/iAPS?fbclid=IwAR2fA9Y9YqYzpKSrtEsotfXl5b67UclDkKgyrv52tQLzYbOoBeNGRmjlJJI), (formerly FreeAPS X). The features of the different systems are shown in the table below:

[OpenAPS](https://openaps.readthedocs.io/) was the first Open Source Closed Loop System. It uses a small computer such as Raspberry Pi or Intel Edison. Both AndroidAPS (AAPS) and iAPS use the OpenAPS algorithms, whereas Loop uses a separate algorithm. You can read a comparison of iAPS and **AAPS** here.

An international peer-reviewed consensus statement containing practical guidance on open source looping was written by and for health-care professionals, and published in a leading medical journal in 2022. It is well worth a read (including for your diabetes clinic) and summarises the main technical differences between the different open-source hybrid closed loop systems: 

 Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol, 2022; 10: 58–74

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8720075/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8720075/)

It is hard to get a “feel” for any system without using it, or talking to others who are using it, so do reach out to others on Facebook/Discord and ask. Most people find that AAPS is incredibly sophisticated in comparison to other hybrid closed loop systems (particularly the commercial systems), with a huge number of potentially customisable settings and features,  discussed above. Some people can find this a little overwhelming in the beginning, but there is no rush to investigate all the possibilities at once, you can progress as slowly or as fast as you would like, and there is help available at every step of the way.  

## Does AAPS use artificial intelligence or any learning algorithm?

No. **AAPS** does not have any complicated machine learning algorithms, multiple-parameter insulin response models, or differential equations. As such, the system is open and transparent in how it works, and has the ability to be understood not just by experts, but also by clinicians and patients. It also means that if you have a sharply varying schedule (maybe switching from a stressful week at work to a relaxing holiday) and are likely to need a significantly different amount of insulin, you can immediately switch **AAPS** to run a weaker/stronger profile. A ‘learning system’ will do this adjustment for you automatically, but is likely to take longer to adjust the insulin delivery.   

## Which system is right for me or my dependent? 

Practically, your choice of system is often restricted by which pump you already have, or can obtain from your medical provider, and your choice of phone (Apple or Android). If you don’t yet have a pump you have the biggest choice of systems. Technology is continually evolving, pumps are being discontinued and new pumps and sensors are being released. Most open-source systems work with the main sensors (Libre and Dexcom) or are quickly adapted to work with new sensors a year or so after they are released (with a bit of time delay for safety and stability testing). 

Most **AAPS **users report more time in range, HbA1c reductions, as well as quality of life improvements from having a system that can auto-adjust basal rates overnight during sleep, and this is true for most hybrid closed loop APS. Some people have a preference for a very simple system which is not very customisable (which means you may prefer a commercial system), and others find this lack of control very frustrating (you may prefer an open-source system). If you (or your dependent) are newly diagnosed, a common route is to get the hang of MDI plus sensor first, then progress to a pump which has the potential for looping, then to **AAPS**, but some people (especially small kids) may go straight to a pump.

It is important to note that the **AAPS** user needs to be proactive to troubleshoot and fix problems themselves, with help from the community. This is a very different mindset to that when using a commercial system. With **AAPS** a user has more control, but also the responsibility, and needs to be comfortable with that. 

## Is it safe to use open-source systems like AAPS? 

A more accurate question is probably “is it safe compared to my current type 1 diabetes insulin delivery system?” since no method of insulin delivery is without risk. There are many checks and balances in place with **AAPS**. A recent paper looked at the use of**** AAPS ****in a computer simulated set-up, [https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/epub/10.1089/dia.2019.0375](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/epub/10.1089/dia.2019.0375) which was an effective way to unobjectively trial how safe and effective the system is. More generally, it is estimated that over 10,000 individuals worldwide are using open-source automated-insulin delivery systems, and uptake continues to increase globally.

Any device that uses radio communications could be hacked, and this is true for a non-looping insulin pump as well. Currently, we are not aware of anyone attempting to harm individuals by hacking their diabetes-related medical equipment. However, there are multiple ways to protect against such risks:  

1.  In the pump settings, limit both the max bolus allowed and max temporary basal settings to amounts that you believe are safest. These are hard limits that we do not believe any malicious hacker could circumvent. 
    
2.  Set your CGM alarms enabled for both highs and lows. 
    
3.  Monitor your insulin delivery online. Nightscout users can set additional alarms to alert for a wide variety of conditions, including conditions that are much more likely to occur than a malicious attack. In addition to highs and lows, Nightscout can display diagnostic data useful for verifying that the pump is operating as desired, including current IOB, pump temporary basal history, pump bolus history. It can also be configured to proactively alert users to undesirable conditions, such as predicted highs and lows, low insulin reservoir, and low pump battery. 
    

If a malicious attack was made on your insulin pump, these strategies would significantly mitigate the risk. Every potential **AAPS** user needs to weigh the risks associated with using **AAPS**, versus the risks of using a different system.  

## How can I approach discussing AAPS with my clinical team?

Depending on the country - link to doctors section of docs

## Q: Why can’t I just download AAPS and use it straight away?  

The **AAPS** app is not provided in Google Play - you have to build it from source code by yourself for legal reasons. **AAPS** is unlicensed, meaning that it does not have approval by any regulatory body authority in any country. **AAPS**is deemed to be carrying out a medical experiment on yourself, and is carried out at the user’s own risk.

Setting up the system requires patience, determination and the gradual development of technical knowledge. All the information and support can be found in these documents, elsewhere online, or from others who have already done it. It is estimated that over 2000 people have successfully built and are currently using **AAPS** worldwide. 

The developers of **AAPS**t ake safety incredibly seriously, and want others to have a good experience of using **AAPS**. That is why it is essential that every user (or carer, if the user is a child):

- builds the AAPS system themself and works through the **objectives** so that they have reasonably good personalised settings and understand the basics of how AAPS ****works by the time they “close the loop”;
    
- backs up their system by exporting and saving important files (like keystore and settings .json file) somewhere safe, so you can setup again quickly if needed;
    
- updates to newer master versions as and when they become available; and
    
- maintains and monitors the system to ensure it is working properly.
    

## Q: What is the connectivity of the AAPS system? 

**Figure 3 (below)** shows one example of the **AAPS** system for a user who do not require any followers interacting with the system. Additional open-source software and platforms which are not shown can also be integrated.  

![21-06-23, AAPS connectivity no followers](https://github.com/openaps/AndroidAPSdocs/assets/94044064/ac40b079-dcca-4b59-939d-acd6e6a4cb66)


**Figure 4 (below)** shows the full potential of the **AAPS** system for a user who has followers and requires a monitor and send adjust the system remotely (like a child with type 1 diabetes). Additional open-source software and platforms which are not shown can also be integrated.

## Q: How does AAPS get continually developed and improved? 

Most **AAPS** users use the fully tested **master** version of AAPS, which has been tested for bugs and problems, before being released to the community. Behind the scenes, the developers try out new improvements, and test these out in “developer” (**dev**) versions of **AAPS** with a user community who are happy to do bug updates at short notice. If the improvements work well, they are then released as a new “master” version of **AAPS**. Any new master release is announced on the Facebook group, so that the mainstream **AAPS** users can read about and update to the new master version. 

Some experienced and confident **AAPS** users conduct experiments with emerging technologies and with dev versions of the **AAPS** app, which can be interesting for the less adventurous users to read about, without having to do it themselves! People tend to share these experiments on the Facebook group too. 

You can read more about some of these experiments and discussion on emerging tech here:

The above table assumes that the user has access to both continuous gluocse monitor and insulin pump. 

*All data from **AAPS** can be made available to healthcare professionals via data sharing platforms, including NightScout that provides logging and real time monitoring of CGM data, insulin delivery, carbohydrate entries, predictions and settings. Nightscout records include daily and weekly reports which can aid healthcare professionals' discussions with type 1 patients with more accurate data on glycemic control and any behavioural considerations.

## Q: What benefits can I get?

With investment of your time, **AAPS** can potentially lead to:

- alleviating the stress and burden of managing type 1 diabetes;
    
- reducing the multitude of mundane decisions that arise from type 1 diabetes;
    
- the provision of personalised and dynamic insulin dosing based on real-time data which can cut down the need for hypo treatments and reduce hyperglycemia episodes;
    
- an increased knowledge of insulin management and confidence to better fine tune your settings;
    
- the ability to create automatic settings (**automations**) that are tailored to fit in with your lifestyle;
    
- improved sleep quality and overall reduction in the frequency of nighttime interventions;
    
- remote monitoring and administration of insulin delivery for caregivers of type 1 diabetics; and
   
- streamlining of all your portable diabetic equipment (continuous glucose monitor and insulin portable devices) by replacing them with an android phone controlled by **AAPS**. 
    

Ultimately,**AAPS** can empower individuals to better manage their diabetes resulting in stable blood sugars and improved long term health outcomes.

## AAPS First Steps 

Welcome. This is an introduction to aid beginners getting started with **AAPS** (or commonly referred to as "looping").

## Safety

“_With great powers comes great responsibilities…_”

**AAPS** is designed with an extensive set of safety features with limits imposed and gradually removed with completion of the **objectives **(predominately made up of multiple choice questions). An **AAPS** feature will be unlocked as the Objectives are successfully completed. This process will gradually allow the user to migrate from Open Loop to Closed Loop.

This has been done to achieve the best possible experience with **AAPS** in order to prevent common mistakes that new users tend to make when starting to loop. The safety parameters have been built upon typical errors and general trends **AAPS** developers have observed with new users. Mistakes can happen because the beginner is inexperienced and too eager to get started with AAPS or has overlooked the required materials. Do not worry, we have all been there!

## Key Principles

The key principles and concepts of looping must be understood by the user before using **AAPS**. This is achieved by investing your personal time into reading the **AAPS** documentation, and completing the Objectives which is aimed to provide you with a solid platform for safe and effective use of **AAPS**. The volume of **AAPS** documentation may seem overwhelming at first but be patient and trust the process - with the proper approach, you'll get there! The overall process will depend upon the beginner’s progress and completion of objectives can typically take between 6 to 9 weeks .

## Plan for hiccups

At the preliminary stages of **AAPS**, you should expect to experience some hiccups whilst trying to fine tune your settings. **AAPS**’ glitches cannot be flushed out until the system is used in everyday life. Please plan accordingly and allow a sensible amount of time to troubleshoot and resolve such issues.

## Flexibility/Adaptability

Success with **AAPS** requires a proactive approach, a willingness to reflect on the BG data and flexibility to make the necessary adjustments to **AAPS** in order to improve your outcomes. Just as it is nearly impossible to learn to play a sport by reading about the rules alone, the same can be said of **AAPS**.

## Technology compatibility

There are limitations with **AAPS** as it is accessible for only certain types of insulin pumps or CGMs, and some technology may not be available for use in various countries. In order to avoid any disappointment or frustrations, please read  please read Component Set Up (Section INSERT).

## App Build Time

The time to build the **AAPS**(under Section INSERT) depends on your level of expertise and technical ability. Typically for inexperienced users, it can take up to half a day or a full day (with help from the community) in order to build the **AAPS**. The process will significantly speed up as you become more experienced at building the **AAPS**. 
To aid the build process there are sections dedicated for:
- list of questions and answers for frequent errors that are likely to occur under FAQs (Section K);
- “How to install AAPS? (Section INSERT) which includes Troubleshooting subsection.

## Keystore & configurations settings a export file 

A “keystore” is a password encrypted file unique to your own copy of **AAPS**. Your android phone uses it to ensure that nobody else can upgrade your own copy without the keystore. In short, as part of the **AAPS** build, you should:

- save the your keystore file (.jks file used to sign your app) in a safe place;
- keep a note of your password for your keystore file.

By doing the above, this will ensure that you can use that exact same keystore file each time an updated version of **AAPS** is created. On average, there will be 2-3 AAPS updates required each year. 

In addition, **AAPS** provides the ability to export all your configuration settings. This ensures that you can safely recover your system while changing phones, upgrading/reinstalling the application with minimum disruption. 

## Troubleshootng 

Please feel free to reach out to the AAPS community if there is anything you feel unsure about - there is no such thing as a silly question! All users with various levels of experience are encouraged to ask questions as necessary. Response times to questions are usually quick, typically only a few hours due to the volume of **AAPS** users. 
 
a) check the documentation;
b) ask AAPS facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/AndroidAPSUsers); and
c) ask our discord channel.

## Section overview

AAPS documentation is made up of the following Sections:
